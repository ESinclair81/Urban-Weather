## Description


* The Urban Weather Dashboard app allows the user to enter the name of a city in the search box, before promting them to click the search button.  After clicking, the app brings forth the current weather conditions in the city searched, including temperature, humidity, UV index, and an image reflecting whether it is clear, cloudy, raining, etc.  The 5-day forecast for that city is also on display below the current conditions as well.

* Once users conduct a search, their search is logged in the console and appears on the left hand side. Users have the option of leaving their searches there or clearing them by pressing the refresh button.
